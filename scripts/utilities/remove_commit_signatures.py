"""
Remove Claude Code signatures from git commit messages.

This script is designed to be used with git filter-branch:

    git filter-branch -f --msg-filter 'scripts/remove_commit_signatures.py' HEAD~10..HEAD

It reads commit messages from stdin and removes:
- Lines containing "Generated with [Claude Code]"
- Lines containing "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
- Trailing empty lines

The cleaned commit message is written to stdout.
