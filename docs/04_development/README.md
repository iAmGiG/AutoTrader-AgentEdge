## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature

1. Read [01_codebase_structure.md](01_codebase_structure.md) for where to place code
2. Check [docs/05_decisions/](../05_decisions/) for relevant architectural patterns
3. Update [02_project_status.md](02_project_status.md) to track your work
4. Create tests in `tests/` following existing patterns
5. Document in `docs/features/` when ready for users

### Fixing a Bug

1. Create a GitHub issue (if not already created)
2. Check [02_project_status.md](02_project_status.md) for related issues
3. Write tests that reproduce the bug
4. Fix the bug
5. Update [02_project_status.md](02_project_status.md) when complete
6. Reference the issue in your commit message

### Improving Performance

1. Profile the code to identify bottlenecks
2. Check [04_cache_developer_guide.md](04_cache_developer_guide.md) for caching strategies
3. Review [docs/05_decisions/03_api_caching_patterns.md](../05_decisions/03_api_caching_patterns.md)
4. Implement improvements with tests
5. Document in commit message and relevant docs

### Understanding How Something Works

1. Start with [01_codebase_structure.md](01_codebase_structure.md) to find the files
2. Read code comments and docstrings
3. Check related ADRs in [docs/05_decisions/](../05_decisions/)
4. Look at tests in `tests/` for usage examples
5. Ask in GitHub issues if stuck

## Code Quality Standards

All code must follow standards documented in:

**Decision Records** ([docs/05_decisions/](../05_decisions/)):

- **01_code_organization.md** - Directory structure and imports
- **02_error_handling_logging.md** - Error handling patterns
- **03_api_caching_patterns.md** - Cache implementation
- **04_agent_singleton_patterns.md** - Agent lifecycle

**Code Quality Guide** ([06_code_quality.md](06_code_quality.md)):

- Linting configuration (Ruff, Black, isort, MyPy)
- Import conventions and patterns
- Type hint guidelines
- Active code quality issues (#409-#413)

Pre-commit hooks enforce:

- Black formatting
- Ruff linting
- isort import ordering
- Trailing whitespace removal
- Security scanning (Bandit)

## Architecture Decisions

Significant design decisions are documented as ADRs. Before making architectural changes, check [docs/05_decisions/](../05_decisions/).

## Testing Strategy

See [docs/testing/](../testing/) for:

- Unit testing guidelines
- Integration testing approach
- Forward testing protocol
- How to run tests
